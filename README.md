# hackathon-apis

### Note:
We are currently putting the finishing touches on the official hackathon repository. Please use this document for the time being to upload the information for your APIs. Fork this repo and commit changes based upon the template below.  
  
You can also communicate with hackers directly in the Discord group, and in your specific sponsor channel. The discord invite link is here: https://discord.gg/5zFX4ac

# APIs
Listed here are the APIs for your use.
* Browse the APIs here. Visit docs etc.
* Meet with the API sponsors at the hackathon, particularly on Saturday morning
* Communicate with the API sponsors via their dedicated Discord channel.



# Netlify
Netlify automates deployment for your frontend, serving your apps and sites over our custom global Content Delivery Network. You won't need server-side rendering with our integrated [prerendering](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering), [proxy redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects), [form handling](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling), [user authentication](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity), [serverless Lambda functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions), and more.

### Purpose
Developers everywhere are using the [JAMstack](https://jamstackconf.com/what-is-jamstack) approach to connect blazing fast frontends to a growing array of microservice APIs. There are lots of advantages to this, but sometimes you need to run a bit of server-side code. It's not worth running a whole server for, and that approach doesn't scale well, anyway. Serverless functions services like AWS Lambda are perfect for this, and Netlify's [new functions add-on](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/03/20/netlifys-aws-lambda-functions-bring-the-backend-to-your-frontend-workflow/) makes it easy to deploy, test, and access your Lambda functions right alongside the rest of your app.

### Challenges
<!-- We are looking for the most interesting app using Netlify's integrated Lambda [functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions).

To be eligible for the prize, your app must be deployed to Netlify, and use at least one Lambda function. -->

# Hasura

Hasura gives you instant, realtime GraphQL APIs for your JAMstack app. With one-click to deploy on Heroku's free tier, you can get started in less than a minute.

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

You don't need to know how to write a GraphQL schema, resolvers or learn how to use
a database to get started! Head to the deployed app, create a table, and run CRUD + realtime with GraphQL :)

![Hasura demo GIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/assets/demo.gif)

You can also use Hasura to trigger Lambda/Serverless functions such as [Netlify
Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) when an event happens on the
database, for example, send an email when a new user is added.

### Purpose

You should use Hasura if your JAMstack app needs to CRUD data, needs a realtime API,
or if you want to trigger webhooks on data changes.

Here are some examples of how you can use Hasura:
- CRUD operations with GraphQL ([sample app](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/todo-auth0-jwt))
- Building a realtime app (sample apps: [chat](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/realtime-chat), [poll](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/realtime-poll), [location tracking](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/realtime-location-tracking))
- Sourcing the data for a gatsby site from a postgres database ([sample app](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/boilerplates/gatsby-postgres-graphql))
- Triggering browser-based notifications if some data changes ([sample app](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/serverless-push))

### Learn in 5 minutes (video tutorials)

Here are a few short videos to help you get started:

1. Explore GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions with a realtime todo app [(video coming soon)]()
2. Send an email when a new user is created using netlify functions [(video coming soon)]()
3. Integrate authentication/authorization with auth0 [(video coming soon)]()

### Support & help

- Join the [Hasura discord server](https://discord.gg/vBPpJkS). We're super active and someone from the team or the community will help out any time of the day if you have any questions!
- Tanmai will be hanging around at the hackathon if you're present offline! Do say Hi and ask him as many questions as you'd like:
